Oauth tokens allow applications to get creditials to
access your information without actually getting
your login information.  The user must agree and set
the permissions that they wish the developer/api to
have access to.

In addition to this, from my understanding, Oauth 
tokens will continue to work even if you change your 
username and password.  If they really don't expire 
and if they were highjacked in the main flow of an 
api, then the specific users data would be permanently 
at risk.

Because of these two reasons, Oauth tokens should not
be granted in the main flow of an api.
